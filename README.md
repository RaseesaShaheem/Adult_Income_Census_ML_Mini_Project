## Adult Income Prediction

## Project Overview

Income level is an important socio-economic indicator that influences quality of life, access to resources, and financial planning. Predicting whether an individual earns more than 50K per year is challenging due to the complex interplay of demographic, educational, and occupational factors. Developing an effective machine learning model can help identify patterns and key factors affecting income, enabling better socio-economic analysis and decision-making.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient classification model to predict whether an individual earns more than 50K per year based on demographic, educational, and occupational attributes. The goal is to identify patterns and factors that influence income, which can help in decision-making.
